User Registration and Authentication
    Create a user registration system.
    Implement user authentication with username and password.
    Develop a mechanism for the server to verify user credentials.
    Change user status to "online" upon successful authentication.

Connecting to the Chat Server
    Enable users to connect to the chat server.
    Prompt users to enter their username and password.
    Implement a method for users to establish a secure connection with the server.

Checking Online Users
    Develop functionality for users to check who is currently online.
    Implement a feature for users to see the online status of other users.

Initiating a Chat
    Allow users to specify the user IDs of the users they want to chat with.
    Design a system for users to invite others to a chat session.
    Ensure that users can invite multiple users to a chat session simultaneously.

Key Generation and Distribution
    Develop a mechanism for the server to generate a symmetric key for the chat session.
    Securely distribute the symmetric key to all specified users and the initiator of the chat.
    Encrypt the symmetric key using the public keys of the respective users.
    Handle cases where one of the specified users is not online.

Symmetric Key Decryption
    Enable users to decrypt the symmetric key using their private keys.
    Ensure that all specified users can successfully decrypt the symmetric key.

Chat Session
    Implement encryption of messages using the symmetric key provided by the server.
    Design a system for delivering encrypted messages to all users participating in the chat.
    Allow any user to choose to leave the conversation.
    Handle disconnections gracefully and update user statuses accordingly.

Support for Digital Signatures
    Provide users with the option to choose between RSA and DSA for digital signatures.
    Implement digital signature schemes for message authentication.
    Ensure that both digital signature schemes are supported throughout the system.

Offline Status
    Change user status to "offline" upon disconnection from the chat server.
    Develop a mechanism for users to check the online status of other users, even when they are offline.
